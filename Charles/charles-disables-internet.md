# Charles Disables Internet on MacBook

Sometimes, when I leave Charles on, and put my MacBook into sleep mode, the next day, it will crash. When this happens, the internet is often down for the machine.

Fix[^1]:
Go to Wi-Fi -> Network -> Details... -> Proxies -> turn off `Web proxy (HTTP)` and `Secure web proxy (HTTPS)`
