# TIL

> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post.

## Usage

After creating a new entry, run `./createReadme.py > README.md` to regenerate
the readme with the new data.

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createReadme.py pre-commit && cd -


## About

I first heard of this idea from [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til)
who seems to have heard of it from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

The script to autogenerate the README was adapted from [jima80525/til](https://github.com/jima80525/til).
