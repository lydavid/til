# Remote-SSH

When I need to edit files using VS Code on server hosts, I use this: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh

However, it often times out and requires reconnecting, so for small configuration tasks, I prefer to use vi through an ssh session in WSL. The ssh session times out, but reconnecting is much simpler.
