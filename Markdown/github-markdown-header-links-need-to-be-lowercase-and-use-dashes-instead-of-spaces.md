- [this still does not work](github-markdown-header-links-need-to-be-lowercase-and-use-dashes-instead-of-spaces.md#this%20still%20does%20not%20work)
- [but-this-does](github-markdown-header-links-need-to-be-lowercase-and-use-dashes-instead-of-spaces.md#but-this-does)

They all work in Obsidian though.

This is mostly relevant for [README](../README.md)'s TOC. I should not have to force myself to write headers in this style anywhere else.

## Test linking to headers within other pages:
- [Pulling changes after creating a submodule](../git/git-submodules-with-different-remote-hosts.md#Pulling%20changes%20after%20creating%20a%20submodule)

It works fine in Obsidian.
